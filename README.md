# Obsidian Block Reference Counts
**By shabegom and Murf**

![](img/readme.png)

Show the amount of references you have in:
- block references
- headings
- block reference links
- embeds

Click on the number to open a table with links to the note with the reference and the line the reference appears on.

That's it. That's the plugin.
